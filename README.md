# 📝 Marks – Canvas LMS Grade Viewer

## 📱 Overview

Marks is a Swift-based iOS application designed to fetch and display student grades from the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS). By integrating with the Canvas API, I was able to figure out how to pull info and display it correctly from a real world API.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Develop an iOS application that interfaces with the Canvas LMS API.
- Implement secure authentication mechanisms for user data retrieval.
- Present grade information in a clear and user-friendly interface.
- Enhance skills in Swift programming and API integration.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Swift
- **Platform:** iOS
- **Development Environment:** Xcode
- **API Integration:** Canvas LMS API
- **Networking:** URLSession for HTTP requests

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- **API Authentication:** Gained experience in handling OAuth2 authentication flows to securely access user data.
- **Data Parsing:** Learned to parse JSON responses from the Canvas API to extract relevant grade information.
- **User Interface Design:** Designed intuitive UI components to display grades and course details effectively.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented robust error handling to manage network failures and API errors gracefully.
